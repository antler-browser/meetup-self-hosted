# Meetup Mini App

A mini app built with Antler IRL Browser that displays a list of everyone that scanned a QR code.

**Note:** This repository is built to deploy to Cloudflare. For self-hosting, see [meetup-cloudflare](https://github.com/antler-browser/meetup-cloudflare). We recommend using Cloudflare because it works on Cloudflare's free tier.

## Overview

This is a pnpm workspace monorepo with three packages:
- **client/** - React frontend
- **server/** - Hono backend (REST API + SSE for real-time updates + SQLite database)
- **shared/** - Shared utilities (JWT verification, Social links, etc.)

### How it works

1. User scans QR code with Antler
2. Client requests profile from `window.irlBrowser.getProfileDetails()` API
3. IRL Browser generates and signs JWT with profile details
4. JWT is sent to server, verified, stored in the database, and broadcasted to all connected clients via SSE
5. All connected clients see real-time list of everyone that scanned the QR code

## Getting Started

Useful commands to run:

```bash
pnpm install          # Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm run dev          # Start both client (localhost:5173) and server (localhost:3000)
pnpm run dev:client   # Start only client
pnpm run dev:server   # Start only server
pnpm run build        # Build all packages (shared → server → client)
pnpm db:generate      # Check schema from server/src/db/schema.ts and generate migration files
pnpm db:push          # Manually run migrations
pnpm db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio visual database manager
```

### Running the app locally

1. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies
2. Copy the `server/.env.example` file to `server/.env`. The defaults should work for local development.
3. Update `data.json` with meetup details
4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start both client and server
5. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. IRL Browser Simulator is enabled in development mode, so you will instantly login with a test profile (Paul Morphy). 
6. If you need to test multiple users using your app, click the IRL Browser Simulator debug panel "Open as X" button to open a new tab and simulate multiple users.

### Self-Hosting with Docker

The app is designed to be easily self-hosted using Docker.

1. Run `docker compose up` to start the app
2. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
3. SQLite database is persisted in a Docker volume, so you can stop and restart your app without losing any data.

### Deploying using Railway

1. Railway uses the Dockerfile in the root of the repository to build the app.
2. Create a new Railway project.
3. Add the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - The URL of the SQLite database (e.g. `file:/app/server/data/meetup.db`)

**Note:** Because the database is stored inside the container, it will reset every time you redeploy the app. You can use a persistent volume to persist the database, or self-host using Docker Compose. The Docker Compose file uses volumes to persist the database.

### Debugging IRL Browser Mini Apps
The IRL Browser Simulator injects the `window.irlBrowser` API into a regular browser, allowing you to test your mini app locally without needing the Antler mobile app.

**Note:** This is a development-only tool and should never be used in production.

```typescript
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  const simulator = await import('irl-browser-simulator')
  simulator.enableIrlBrowserSimulator()
}
```

That's it! The simulator will:
- Inject `window.irlBrowser` into your page
- Load a default test profile (Paul Morphy)
- Show a floating debug panel
- Click "Open as X" to open a new tab and simulate multiple users
- Load a profile from the URL parameter `?irlProfile=<id>`

## Tech Stack

### Frontend (client/)
- **React** - UI library
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **qrcode.react** - Display QR code
- **irl-browser-simulator** - IRL Browser debugging (dev only)

### Backend (server/)
- **Hono** - REST API framework
- **@hono/node-server** - Node.js adapter
- **Drizzle ORM** - TypeScript ORM for database operations
- **@libsql/client** - LibSQL/SQLite client for database operations
